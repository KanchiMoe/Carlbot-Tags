    "description":":small_blue_diamond: **How do I get promoted?**\n> Just show consistent activity and be respectful! Promotions will happen automatically on a monthly basis. Keep in mind to be promoted you must also have mostly positive interactions with the community and be an example for the other students. Troublesome students will not be promoted. \n\n:small_blue_diamond: **How can I get a cool colour?**\n> Simple! Go to <#563851110541033473> and choose your role for your favorite character or by colour.\n\n:small_blue_diamond: **What is Clout?**\n> For the love of all that is holy.. Do not inquire about this as many students who have done so now struggle to get homework done on time. Surely staying up another three hours to roll again won\u2019t hurt right? In all seriousness, it's a waifu gacha game. Roll, claim and trade your favourite waifus\/husbandos.\n\n:small_blue_diamond: **What happens if I break a rule?**\n> First you will be given the <@&411700281366151178>, which will temporarily mute you from the server. This is either so we can stop you from whatever you are doing or to let you sit in the corner and think about what you\u2019ve done. Afterwards, punishments will be handled on a case by case basis. We don\u2019t like to ban, and we don\u2019t do it often. Don\u2019t make us do it.\n\n**That's it for now!**\nEnjoy your time in the server!",
